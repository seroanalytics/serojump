## Overview

The `serojump` package provides tools for fitting serological models to antibody kinetics data using reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC). It enables researchers to model the dynamics of antibody levels in response to infections, incorporating both observational and antibody kinetics models. The package supports the inclusion of priors and various exposure scenarios, making it highly flexible for serological data analysis.

This package is ideal for researchers looking to:

- Model antibody kinetics over time
- Estimate infection rates and antibody waning using serological data
- Perform MCMC inference on serological models

The best place to get started with serojump is our preprint (coming soon). In this repo, ceveral model templates are provided to simplify usage, while also allowing users to customize models for specific research questions.

## Installation

To install the `serojump` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install R

Make sure you have R installed on your system. You can download R from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Step 2: Install `serojump` from GitHub

You can install the development version of `serojump` from GitHub using the `devtools` package. If you don't already have `devtools` installed, you can install it with:


```

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("seroanalytics/serojump")

```

### Step 3: Load `serojump` from GitHub
After installation, you can load the serojump package into your R session with:


```

library(serojump)

```
