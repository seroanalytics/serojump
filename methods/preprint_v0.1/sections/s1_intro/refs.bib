              causing reinfection. The form and duration of protection after
              each influenza virus infection are poorly understood. We quantify
              the dynamics of protective immunity by fitting individual-level
              mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and
              adults. We find that most protection in children but not adults
              correlates with antibody titers to the hemagglutinin surface
              protein. Protection against circulating strains wanes to half of
              peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in both age groups, and
              wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09.
              Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children.
              Our results suggest that influenza antibody responses shift focus
              with age from the mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes,
              consistent with the theory of original antigenic sin, and might
              affect protection. Imprinting, or primary infection with a
              subtype, has modest to no effect on the risk of non-medically

  abstract = "The strength and breadth of an individual's antibody repertoire
              is an important predictor of their response to influenza
              infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in
              understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the
              antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding
              remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models
              describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza
              infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination
              inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were
              exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated
              influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming
              inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit
              models with various immunological mechanisms that have been
              empirically observed but have not previously been included in
              mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including: titre
              ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific
              cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best
              supported models, we describe a number of key immunological
              features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of
              homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by
              different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination
              generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas
              unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We
              found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2
              improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of
              adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody
              boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre
              ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models,
              suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody
              boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable
              uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our
              results suggest that both short and long term waning were present
              and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These
              results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal
              models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics

              longitudinal serological data. The published model assumed
              exponential decay with fixed rates for pathogen and serum
              antibody kinetics, ignoring any within-host heterogeneity in the
              seroresponse. A bi-exponential model shows that there is rapid
              initial decay followed by a prolonged period of persistent low
              serum antibody concentrations. We propose a small modification of

              allowing for non-exponential antibody decay. The modified model
              produces power functions that may be interpreted as a mixture of

              the relative contribution of many centres of antibody production

  author   = "Cutts, Felicity T and Hanson, Matt",
  abstract = "Seroepidemiology, the use of data on the prevalence of
              bio-markers of infection or vaccination, is a potentially
              powerful tool to understand the epidemiology of infection before
              vaccination and to monitor the effectiveness of vaccination
              programmes. Global and national burden of disease estimates for
              hepatitis B and rubella are based almost exclusively on
              serological data. Seroepidemiology has helped in the design of
              measles, poliomyelitis and rubella elimination programmes, by
              informing estimates of the required population immunity
              thresholds for elimination. It contributes to monitoring of these
              programmes by identifying population immunity gaps and evaluating
              the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Seroepidemiological
              data have also helped to identify contributing factors to
              resurgences of diphtheria, Haemophilus Influenzae type B and
              pertussis. When there is no confounding by antibodies induced by
              natural infection (as is the case for tetanus and hepatitis B
              vaccines), seroprevalence data provide a composite picture of
              vaccination coverage and effectiveness, although they cannot
              reliably indicate the number of doses of vaccine received.
              Despite these potential uses, technological, time and cost
              constraints have limited the widespread application of this tool
              in low-income countries. The use of venous blood samples makes it
              difficult to obtain high participation rates in surveys, but the
              performance of assays based on less invasive samples such as
              dried blood spots or oral fluid has varied greatly. Waning
              antibody levels after vaccination may mean that seroprevalence
              underestimates immunity. This, together with variation in assay
              sensitivity and specificity and the common need to take account
              of antibody induced by natural infection, means that relatively
              sophisticated statistical analysis of data is required.
              Nonetheless, advances in assays on minimally invasive samples may
              enhance the feasibility of including serology in large survey
              programmes in low-income countries. In this paper, we review the
              potential uses of seroepidemiology to improve vaccination
              policymaking and programme monitoring and discuss what is needed
              to broaden the use of this tool in low- and middle-income

              at community level is unknown. The incidence rate of influenza
              virus infections in the community is difficult to determine due
              to the lack of well-defined catchment populations of
              influenza-like illness surveillance sentinel hospitals.
              OBJECTIVES: We established a community-based cohort to estimate
              incidence of seasonal influenza infections indicated by serology
              and protection conferred by antibody titers against influenza
              infections during 2018-2019 influenza season in northern China.
              METHODS: We recruited participants in November 2018 and conducted
              follow-up in May 2019 with collection of sera every survey.
              Seasonal influenza infections were indicated by a 4-fold or
              greater increase of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody
              between paired sera. RESULTS: Two hundred and three children 5-17
              years of age and 413 adults 18-59 years of age were followed up
              and provided paired sera. The overall incidence of seasonal
              influenza infection and incidence of A(H3N2) infection in
              children (31\% and 17\%, respectively) were significantly higher
              than those in adults (21\% and 10\%, respectively). The
              incidences of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in children and adults were
              both about 10\%, while the incidences of B/Victoria and/Yamagata
              infection in children and adults were from 2\% to 4\%. HI titers
              of 1:40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were associated
              with 63\% and 75\% protection against infections with the two
              subtypes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the community, we
              identified considerable incidence of seasonal influenza
              infections. A HI titer of 1:40 could be sufficient to provide
              50\% protection against influenza A virus infections indicated by
              serology.",

              determine the incidence of a given disease based on cases
              notified to routine public health surveillance. This is
              especially true for diseases that are often present in mild forms
              as for example diarrhoea caused by foodborne bacterial
              infections. This study presents a Bayesian approach for obtaining
              incidence estimates by use of measurements of serum antibodies
              against Salmonella from a cross-sectional study. By comparing
              these measurements with antibody measurements from a follow-up
              study of infected individuals it was possible to estimate the
              time since last infection for each individual in the
              cross-sectional study. These time estimates were then converted
              into incidence estimates. Information about the incidence of
              Salmonella infections in Denmark was obtained by using blood
              samples from 1780 persons. The estimated incidence was about

              diseases is crucial to guide public health policy and prioritize
              interventions. Typically, infectious disease surveillance relies
              on capturing clinical cases within a healthcare system,
              classifying cases by etiology and enumerating cases over a period
              of time. Disease burden is often then extrapolated to the general
              population. Serology (i.e., examining serum for the presence of
              pathogen-specific antibodies) has long been used to inform about
              individuals past exposure and immunity to specific pathogens.
              However, it has been underutilized as a tool to evaluate the
              infectious disease burden landscape at the population level and
              guide public health decisions. In this review, we outline how
              serology provides a powerful tool to complement case-based
              surveillance for determining disease burden and epidemiology of
              infectious diseases, highlighting its benefits and limitations.
              We describe the current serology-based technologies and
              illustrate their use with examples from both the pre- and post-
              COVID-19-pandemic context. In particular, we review the
              challenges to and opportunities in implementing serological
              surveillance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which
              bear the brunt of the global infectious disease burden. Finally,
              we discuss the relevance of serology data for public health
              decision-making and describe scenarios in which this data could
              be used, either independently or in conjunction with case-based
              surveillance. We conclude that public health systems would
              greatly benefit from the inclusion of serology to supplement and

              epidemiological and biological insights that are possible using

              review focuses on methods to understand transmission dynamics and
              infer past exposures from serological data, referred to as
              serodynamics, though we note that such analyses often address
              complementary immunological questions. We first discuss key
              considerations for data processing and interpretation of raw
              serological data which are prerequisite for fitting serodynamical
              models. We then review a range of approaches for estimating

              infection, and investigate the impact of antibody titres on assay
              sensitivity. Methods: HCWs at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS
              Foundation Trust were prospectively enrolled and sampled at two
              time points. We developed an in-house ELISA for testing
              participant serum for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA reactivity against
              Spike and Nucleoprotein. Data were analysed using three
              statistical models: a seroprevalence model, an antibody kinetics
              model, and a heterogeneous sensitivity model. Results: Our
              in-house assay had a sensitivity of 99·47\% and specificity of
              99·56\%. We found that 24·4\% (n=311/1275) of HCWs were
              seropositive as of 12th June 2020. Of these, 39·2\% (n=122/311)
              were asymptomatic. The highest adjusted seroprevalence was
              measured in HCWs on the Acute Medical Unit (41·1\%, 95\% CrI
              30·0-52·9) and in Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists
              (39·2\%, 95\% CrI 24·4-56·5). Older age groups showed overall
              higher median antibody titres. Further modelling suggests that,
              for a serological assay with an overall sensitivity of 80\%,
              antibody titres may be markedly affected by differences in age,
              with sensitivity estimates of 89\% in those over 60 years but
              61\% in those $\leq$30 years. Conclusions: HCWs in acute medical
              units and those working closely with COVID-19 patients were at
              highest risk of infection, though whether these are infections
              acquired from patients or other staff is unknown. Current
              serological assays may underestimate seroprevalence in younger

              limited and access to health care is difficult. Current
              epidemiological trends of several neglected tropical diseases in
              these populations are at present absent due to the lack of
              habitual and efficient surveillance. To date, various studies
              have explored the utility of serological multiplex beads to
              monitor numerous diseases simultaneously. We therefore applied
              this platform to assess population level exposure to six
              infectious diseases in Sabah, Malaysia. Furthermore, we
              concurrently investigated demographic and spatial risk factors
              that may be associated with exposure for each disease. METHODS:
              This study was conducted in four districts of Northern Sabah in
              Malaysian Borneo, using an environmentally stratified,
              population-based cross-sectional serological survey targeted to
              determine risk factors for malaria. Samples were collected
              between September to December 2015, from 919 villages totaling
              10,100 persons. IgG responses to twelve antigens of six diseases
              (lymphatic filariasis- Bm33, Bm14, BmR1, Wb123; strongyloides-
              NIE; toxoplasmosis-SAG2A; yaws- Rp17 and TmpA; trachoma- Pgp3,
              Ct694; and giardiasis- VSP3, VSP5) were measured using
              serological multiplex bead assays. Eight demographic risk factors
              and twelve environmental covariates were included in this study
              to better understand transmission in this community. RESULTS:
              Seroprevalence of LF antigens included Bm33 (10.9\%), Bm14+ BmR1
              (3.5\%), and Wb123 (1.7\%). Seroprevalence of Strongyloides
              antigen NIE was 16.8\%, for Toxoplasma antigen SAG2A was 29.9\%,
              and Giardia antigens GVSP3 + GVSP5 was 23.2\%. Seroprevalence
              estimates for yaws Rp17 was 4.91\%, for TmpA was 4.81\%, and for
              combined seropositivity to both antigens was 1.2\%.
              Seroprevalence estimates for trachoma Pgp3 + Ct694 were 4.5\%.
              Age was a significant risk factors consistent among all antigens
              assessed, while other risk factors varied among the different
              antigens. Spatial heterogeneity of seroprevalence was observed
              more prominently in lymphatic filariasis and toxoplasmosis.
              CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex bead assays can be used to assess
              serological responses to numerous pathogens simultaneously to
              support infectious disease surveillance in rural communities,
              especially where prevalences estimates are lacking for neglected
              tropical diseases. Demographic and spatial data collected
              alongside serosurveys can prove useful in identifying risk

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) activity has been reported in
              Dhaka, Bangladesh since the early 1960s with the greatest burden
              of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases observed in
              2000. Since this time, the intensity of dengue activity has
              varied from year to year, and its determining factors remained
              relatively unknown. In light of such gaps in knowledge, the main
              objectives of this study were to determine the magnitude of
              seroprevalence and seroconversion among the surveyed population,
              and establish the individual/household level risk factors for the
              presence of DENV antibodies among all age groups of target
              populations in the city of Dhaka. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Considering the lack of fine scale investigations on the factors
              driving dengue activity in Bangladesh, a prospective cohort study
              involving serological surveys was undertaken with participant
              interviews and blood donation across the city of Dhaka in 2012.
              Study participants were recruited from 12 of 90 wards and blood
              samples were collected during both the pre-monsoon (n = 1125) and
              post-monsoon (n = 600) seasons of 2012. The findings revealed
              that the seroprevalence in all pre-monsoon samples was 80.0\%
              (900/1125) while the seropositivity in the pre-monsoon samples
              that had paired post-monsoon samples was 83.3\% (503/600). Of the
              97 paired samples that were negative at the pre-monsoon time
              point, 56 were positive at the post-monsoon time point. This
              resulted in a seroprevalence of 93.2\% (559/600) among
              individuals tested during the post-monsoon period. Seroprevalence
              trended higher with age with children exhibiting a lower
              seropositivity as compared to adults. Results from this study
              also indicated that DENV strains were the only flaviviruses
              circulating in Dhaka in 2012. A multivariate analysis revealed
              that age, possession of indoor potted plants, and types of
              mosquito control measures were significant factors associated
              with DENV seroprevalence; while attendance in public/mass
              gatherings, and use of mosquito control measures were
              significantly associated with DENV seroconversion after adjusting
              for all other variables. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study
              suggests that there is a high level of endemic dengue virus
              circulation in the city of Dhaka which has resulted in
              significant DENV seroprevalence among its residents.
              Seropositivity increased with age, however, a substantial
              proportion of children are at risk for DENV infections. Our
              serological analysis also documents considerable DENV
              seroconversion among study participants which indicates that a
              large proportion of the population in the city of Dhaka were
              newly exposed to DENV during the study period (pre-and
              post-monsoon 2012). High levels of seroconversion suggest that
              there was an intense circulation of DENV in 2012 and this may
              have resulted in a significant risk for viral associated illness.
              Findings of our study further indicated that home-based
              interventions, such as removing indoor potted plants and
              increased bed net use, in addition to vector control measures in
              public parks, would reduce exposure to DENV and further decrease
              risk of viral associated disease.",

              carried out a prospective study on a cohort of university
              students. All EBV-seronegative students were asked to report
              symptoms of IM and were followed up 3 years later to undergo
              repeat EBV testing and to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. EBV
              typing was performed for these subjects, as well as for students
              who were EBV seropositive at enrollment and for additional
              students with IM. RESULTS: A total of 510 students (25\%) who
              took part in the study were EBV seronegative when they entered
              the university; of the 241 who donated a second blood sample 3
              years later, 110 (46\%) had seroconverted to EBV, 27 (25\%) of
              whom developed IM [corrected] Penetrative sexual intercourse was
              a risk factor for EBV seroconversion (P = .004), but neither
              condom use nor oral sex significantly altered the rate of
              seroconversion. EBV type 1 was significantly overrepresented in
              IM, compared with silent seroconversion (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS:
              Our findings suggest that acquisition of EBV is enhanced by
              penetrative sexual intercourse, although transmission could occur
              through related sexual behaviors, such as ``deep kissing.'' We
              also found that EBV type 1 infection is significantly more likely
              to result in IM. Overall, the results suggest that a large EBV
              type 1 load acquired during sexual intercourse can rapidly
              colonize the B cell population and induce the exaggerated T cell
              response that causes IM. Thus, IM could, perhaps, be prevented
              with a vaccine that reduces the viral load without necessarily
              inducing sterile immunity.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Serological surveys with multiplex bead assays can be
              used to assess seroprevalence to multiple pathogens
              simultaneously. However, multiple methods have been used to
              generate cut-off values for seropositivity and these may lead to
              inconsistent interpretation of results. A literature review was
              conducted to describe the methods used to determine cut-off
              values for data generated by multiplex bead assays.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A search was conducted in PubMed
              that included articles published from January 2010 to January
              2020, and 308 relevant articles were identified that included the
              terms ``serology'', ``cut-offs'', and ``multiplex bead assays''.
              After application of exclusion of articles not relevant to
              neglected tropical diseases (NTD), vaccine preventable diseases
              (VPD), or malaria, 55 articles were examined based on their
              relevance to NTD or VPD. The most frequently applied approaches
              to determine seropositivity included the use of presumed
              unexposed populations, mixture models, receiver operating curves
              (ROC), and international standards. Other methods included the
              use of quantiles, pre-exposed endemic cohorts, and visual
              inflection points. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For disease control
              programmes, seropositivity is a practical and easily
              interpretable health metric but determining appropriate cut-offs
              for positivity can be challenging. Considerations for optimal
              cut-off approaches should include factors such as methods
              recommended by previous research, transmission dynamics, and the
              immunological backgrounds of the population. In the absence of
              international standards for estimating seropositivity in a
              population, the use of consistent methods that align with
              individual disease epidemiological data will improve
              comparability between settings and enable the assessment of

              is clear that some individuals with potential exposure, or even
              experimental challenge with the virus, resist developing a
              detectable infection. While a proportion of seronegative
              individuals will have completely avoided exposure to the virus, a
              growing body of evidence suggests a subset of individuals are
              exposed, but mediate rapid viral clearance before the infection
              is detected by PCR or seroconversion. This type of ``abortive''
              infection likely represents a dead-end in transmission and
              precludes the possibility for development of disease. It is,
              therefore, a desirable outcome on exposure and a setting in which
              highly effective immunity can be studied. Here, we describe how
              early sampling of a new pandemic virus using sensitive
              immunoassays and a novel transcriptomic signature can identify
              abortive infections. Despite the challenges in identifying
              abortive infections, we highlight diverse lines of evidence
              supporting their occurrence. In particular, expansion of
              virus-specific T cells in seronegative individuals suggests
              abortive infections occur not only after exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
              but for other coronaviridae, and diverse viral infections of
              global health importance (e.g., HIV, HCV, HBV). We discuss
              unanswered questions related to abortive infection, such as: 'Are
              we just missing antibodies? Are T cells an epiphenomenon? What is
              the influence of the dose of viral inoculum?' Finally, we argue

              involved in clearing established infection; instead, we emphasise
              the importance of considering their role in terminating early

              responses observed after detectable infection (matched concurrent

              increase in IFI27, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2
              (ref. 14), suggesting abortive infection. RNA polymerase within

              province (urban site) from July, 2020 to August, 2021. We
              randomly selected households for the rural site from a health and
              sociodemographic surveillance system and for the urban site using
              GPS coordinates. Households with more than two members and where
              at least 75\% of members consented to participate were eligible.
              Midturbinate nasal swabs were collected twice a week from
              household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for
              SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Serum was collected
              every 2 months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Main
              outcomes were the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
              frequency of reinfection, symptomatic fraction (percent of
              infected individuals with $\geq$1 symptom), the duration of viral
              RNA shedding (number of days of SARS-CoV-2 RT-rtPCR positivity),
              and the household cumulative infection risk (HCIR; number of
              infected household contacts divided by the number of susceptible
              household members). FINDINGS: 222 households (114 at the rural
              site and 108 at the urban site), and 1200 household members (643
              at the rural site and 557 at the urban site) were included in the
              analysis. For 115 759 nasal specimens from 1200 household members
              (follow-up 92·5\%), 1976 (1·7\%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive on
              RT-rtPCR. By RT-rtPCR and serology combined, 749 of 1200
              individuals (62·4\% [95\% CI 58·1-66·4]) had at least one
              SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 87 of 749 (11·6\% [9·4-14·2])
              were reinfected. The mean infection episode duration was 11·6
              days (SD 9·0; range 4-137). Of 662 RT-rtPCR-confirmed episodes
              (>14 days after the start of follow-up) with available data, 97
              (14·7\% [11·9-17·9]) were symptomatic with at least one symptom
              (in individuals aged 30) of the index case (OR 5·3 [2·3-12·4])
              and beta and delta variant infection (vs Wuhan-Hu-1, OR 3·3
              [1·4-8·2] and 10·4 [4·1-26·7], respectively) were associated with
              increased HCIR. People living with HIV who were not virally
              supressed ($\geq$400 viral load copies per mL) were more likely
              to develop symptomatic illness when infected with SAR-CoV-2 (OR
              3·3 [1·3-8·4]), and shed SARS-CoV-2 for longer (hazard ratio 0·4
              [95\% CI 0·3-0·6]) compared with HIV-uninfected individuals.
              INTERPRETATION: In this study, 565 (85·3\%) SARS-CoV-2 infections
              were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect
              HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting
              symptomatic individuals. Increased household transmission of beta
              and delta variants was likely to have contributed to successive
              waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with more than 60\% of individuals
              infected by the end of follow-up. FUNDING: US CDC, South Africa

  abstract = "Serological studies are the gold standard method to estimate
              influenza infection attack rates (ARs) in human populations. In a
              common protocol, blood samples are collected before and after the
              epidemic in a cohort of individuals; and a rise in
              haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers during the
              epidemic is considered as a marker of infection. Because of
              inherent measurement errors, a 2-fold rise is usually considered
              as insufficient evidence for infection and seroconversion is
              therefore typically defined as a 4-fold rise or more. Here, we
              revisit this widely accepted 70-year old criterion. We develop a
              Markov chain Monte Carlo data augmentation model to quantify
              measurement errors and reconstruct the distribution of latent
              true serological status in a Vietnamese 3-year serological
              cohort, in which replicate measurements were available. We
              estimate that the 1-sided probability of a 2-fold error is 9.3\%
              (95\% Credible Interval, CI: 3.3\%, 17.6\%) when antibody titer
              is below 10 but is 20.2\% (95\% CI: 15.9\%, 24.0\%) otherwise.
              After correction for measurement errors, we find that the
              proportion of individuals with 2-fold rises in antibody titers
              was too large to be explained by measurement errors alone.
              Estimates of ARs vary greatly depending on whether those
              individuals are included in the definition of the infected
              population. A simulation study shows that our method is unbiased.
              The 4-fold rise case definition is relevant when aiming at a
              specific diagnostic for individual cases, but the justification
              is less obvious when the objective is to estimate ARs. In
              particular, it may lead to large underestimates of ARs.
              Determining which biological phenomenon contributes most to
              2-fold rises in antibody titers is essential to assess bias with
              the traditional case definition and offer improved estimates of
              influenza ARs.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Within-host models describe the dynamics of immune
              cells when encountering a pathogen, and how these dynamics can
              lead to an individual-specific immune response. This systematic
              review aims to summarize which within-host methodology has been
              used to study and quantify antibody kinetics after infection or
              vaccination. In particular, we focus on data-driven and
              theory-driven mechanistic models. MATERIALS: PubMed and Web of
              Science databases were used to identify eligible papers published
              until May 2022. Eligible publications included those studying
              mathematical models that measure antibody kinetics as the primary
              outcome (ranging from phenomenological to mechanistic models).
              RESULTS: We identified 78 eligible publications, of which 8
              relied on an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based
              modelling approach to describe antibody kinetics after
              vaccination, and 12 studies used such models in the context of
              humoral immunity induced by natural infection. Mechanistic
              modeling studies were summarized in terms of type of study,
              sample size, measurements collected, antibody half-life,
              compartments and parameters included, inferential or analytical
              method, and model selection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance
              of investigating antibody kinetics and underlying mechanisms of
              (waning of) the humoral immunity, few publications explicitly
              account for this in a mathematical model. In particular, most
              research focuses on phenomenological rather than mechanistic
              models. The limited information on the age groups or other risk
              factors that might impact antibody kinetics, as well as a lack of
              experimental or observational data remain important concerns
              regarding the interpretation of mathematical modeling results. We
              reviewed the similarities between the kinetics following
              vaccination and infection, emphasising that it may be worth
              translating some features from one setting to another. However,
              we also stress that some biological mechanisms need to be
              distinguished. We found that data-driven mechanistic models tend
              to be more simplistic, and theory-driven approaches lack
              representative data to validate model results.",

              challenging and crucial for further research in immunology,

              cells, which have recently been shown to reside in survival
              niches in the bone marrow, are instrumental in the process of
              immunity induction and persistence. We developed a mathematical
              model, assuming two antibody-secreting cell subpopulations
              (short- and long-lived plasma cells), to analyze the antibody
              kinetics after HAV-vaccination using data from two long-term
              follow-up studies. Model parameters were estimated through a
              hierarchical nonlinear mixed-effects model analysis. Long-term
              individual predictions were derived from the individual empirical
              parameters and were used to estimate the mean time to immunity
              waning. We show that three life spans are essential to explain
              the observed antibody kinetics: that of the antibodies (around
              one month), the short-lived plasma cells (several months) and the
              long-lived plasma cells (decades). Although our model is a
              simplified representation of the actual mechanisms that govern

  abstract = "Humoral immunity following vaccination or infection is mainly
              derived from two types of cells: memory B cells and plasma cells.
              Memory B cells do not actively secrete antibody but instead
              maintain their immunoglobulin in the membrane-bound form that
              serves as the antigen-specific B-cell receptor. In contrast,
              plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells that no longer
              express surface-bound immunoglobulin but continuously secrete
              antibody without requiring further antigenic stimulation.
              Pre-existing serum or mucosal antibody elicited by plasma cells
              (or other intermediate antibody-secreting cells) represents the
              first line of defense against reinfection and is critical for
              protection against many microbial diseases. However, the
              mechanisms involved with maintaining long-term antibody

              described as the 'Imprinted Lifespan' model of plasma cell
              longevity. The foundation of this model is that plasma cells are
              imprinted with a predetermined lifespan based on the magnitude of
              B-cell signaling that occurs during the induction of an
              antigen-specific humoral immune response. This represents a
              testable hypothesis and may explain why some antigen-specific
              antibody responses fade over time whereas others are maintained
