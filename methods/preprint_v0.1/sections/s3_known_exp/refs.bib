  abstract = "We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain
              biological and epidemiological insights from serological
              datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain
              pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed
              antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on
              multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive
              antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to
              jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses
              generated by these infections using antibody titres against
              current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent
              infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics
              that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to
              provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that
              can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case
              studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological
              parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and
              cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such
              as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.",
