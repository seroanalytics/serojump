  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A scaled logit model has previously been proposed to
              quantify the relationship between an immunological assay and
              protection from disease, and has been applied in a number of
              settings. The probability of disease was modelled as a function
              of the probability of exposure, which was assumed to be fixed,
              and of protection, which was assumed to increase smoothly with
              the value of the assay. METHODS: Some extensions are here
              investigated. Alternative functions to represent the protection
              curve are explored, applications to case-cohort designs are
              evaluated, and approaches to variance estimation compared. The
              steepness of the protection curve must sometimes be bounded to
              achieve convergence and methods for doing so are outlined.
              Criteria for evaluating the fit of models are proposed and
              approaches to assessing the utility of results suggested. Models
              are evaluated by application to sixteen datasets from vaccine
              clinical trials. RESULTS: Alternative protection curve functions
              improved model evaluation criteria for every dataset. Standard
              errors based on the observed information were found to be
              unreliable; bootstrap estimates of precision were to be
              preferred. In most instances, case-cohort designs resulted in
              little loss of precision. Some results achieved suggested
              measures for utility. CONCLUSIONS: The original scaled logit
              model can be improved upon. Evaluation criteria permit
              well-fitting models and useful results to be identified. The
              proposed methods provide a comprehensive set of tools for
              quantifying the relationship between immunological assays and
              protection from disease.",

  abstract = "We analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses
              to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
              infection and vaccination using >8,000 longitudinal samples
              collected over a three-year period (April 2020 -- April 2023) in
              the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization,
              participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody
              responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared
              to na{\"\i}ve individuals. Antibody durability was characterized
              by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of
              stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual
              spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination
              equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants
              with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached
              decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through
              infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an
              additional vaccine dose in na{\"\i}ve individuals. Our study
              provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody
              responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed
              by a stabilization phase. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The
              Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent
              applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and

              co-inventor. Dr. Viviana Simon is also listed on the SARS-CoV-2
              serological assays patent. Mount Sinai has spun out a company,
              Kantaro, to market serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. Florian
              Krammer has consulted for Curevac, Merck and Pfizer, and is

  abstract = "serosim is an open-source R package designed to aid inference
              from serological studies, by simulating data arising from
              user-specified vaccine and antibody kinetics processes using a
              random effects model. Serological data are used to assess
              population immunity by directly measuring individuals' antibody
              titers. They uncover locations and/or populations which are
              susceptible and provide evidence of past infection or vaccination
              to help inform public health measures and surveillance. Both
              serological data and new analytical techniques used to interpret
              them are increasingly widespread. This creates a need for tools
              to simulate serological studies and the processes underlying
              observed titer values, as this will enable researchers to
              identify best practices for serological study design, and provide
              a standardized framework to evaluate the performance of different
              inference methods. serosim allows users to specify and adjust
              model inputs representing underlying processes responsible for
              generating the observed titer values like time-varying patterns
              of infection and vaccination, population demography, immunity and
              antibody kinetics, and serological sampling design in order to
              best represent the population and disease system(s) of interest.
              This package will be useful for planning sampling design of
              future serological studies, understanding determinants of
              observed serological data, and validating the accuracy and power
              of new statistical methods.",
