               Markov chain methods",
  author    = "Gibson, Gavin J and Renshaw, Eric",
  abstract  = "Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology is presented for estimating
               parameters in stochastic compartmental models from incomplete
               observations of the corresponding Markov process. The methods,
               which are based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are
               developed in the context of epidemic models. Their use is
               illustrated for the particular case where only susceptible,
               infective, and removed states are represented using simulated
               realizations of the process. By comparing estimated likelihoods
               with theoretical forms, in cases where these can be derived, or
               with the known model parameters, we show that the methods can be
               used to provide meaningful estimates of parameters and parameter
               uncertainty. Potential applications of the techniques are also
               discussed.",
